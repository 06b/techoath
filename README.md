# Tech Oath
Technologists today wield a powerful tool. We are designing, prioritizing, and putting things out into the world, affecting people we have never met. We are on their wrists, in their laptops, in their pockets, and thus, in their heads. Sometimes the ethics are in clear black and white, but at other times it can be a bit more complicated.

Originally this was a personal endeavor, made as a standard that I could adhere to myself during a period of especially consequential design work. But as I’ve slowly widened the circle of colleagues I’ve shared it with, some of them have also found value in it. Perhaps you will as well.
